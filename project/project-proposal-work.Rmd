### Names of the students in the group.

Dheeraj Pasikanti, **Nico Salm**, Jinming Liu
### Communication Plan

> A brief description of how the group will communicate and work together.

- When during the week can the group meet? Consider needs of all group members.
Tuesday/Thursday Mornings (around 9)

- What platforms will the group use to communicate and share documents?
Text, email, drive

### Questions of Interest

> The question or questions of interest that motivate the planned study.

Does the performance of the U.S. economy have a statistically significant influence on the economic growth of other countries, and if so, what is the nature of this influence in terms of variables such as trade and CPI? Is it stratiﬁed by region and income group, and if so, how?
### Source of the data

> The source(s) of data.
    
1. World Economic Outlook. (October 2023). Real GDP growth by annual percent change. Retrieved on November 5, 2023, from https://www.imf.org/external/datamapper/NGDP_RPCH@WEO/OEMDC/ADVEC/

* This data was collected by World Economic Outlook and measures the real GDP growth of countries around the world. The data was collected by the IMF and is updated every year. The key variables in this data set are the real `GDP growth` of each country, the `year`, and the `country` itself. A single row of the data set represents the real GDP growth of a country in a given year. The larger population is the real GDP growth of all countries in the world.

2. The World Bank. (October 2023). World Development Indicators. Retrieved on November 5, 2023, from https://databank.worldbank.org/source/world-development-indicators

* This data was collected by the World Bank and categorizes countries by numerous development indicators including region and income group. The data was collected by the World Bank and is updated every year. The key variables in this data set are the geographic `region`, `income group`, and `country`. There are many other variables too. A single row of the data set represents the region and income group of a country. The larger population is the region and income group of all countries in the world.

### Graph

> Include a description of a graph which will show how the data informs the primary question of interest.

We will create a faceted scatterplot of the real GDP growth of countries over time. The x-axis will be the year and the y-axis will be the real GDP growth. The countries will be faceted by region. This will allow us to see the real GDP growth of countries over time and how it differs by region.

We will also create a faceted scatterplot of the real GDP growth of countries over time. The x-axis will be the year and the y-axis will be the real GDP growth. The countries will be faceted by income group. This will allow us to see the real GDP growth of countries over time and how it differs by income group.

### Model

> Include a description of a possible model for the data and associated methods of inference or prediction.

To analyze the effect of the U.S. economy's performance on the economic growth of other countries while accounting for the factors such as trade, CPI, region, and income group, we might construct a panel data regression model. Panel data, also known as longitudinal data or cross-sectional time-series data, is a dataset in which multiple entities (such as different countries) are observed across time. In R, we would make use of the `plm` package to construct a panel data regression model. We would use the **fixed effects model**, which is a model that includes a dummy variable for each entity in the dataset. This model would allow us to control for the factors such as `region` and `income group`. We would also use the **random effects model**, which is a model that includes a random variable for each entity in the dataset. This model would allow us to control for the factors such as `trade` and `CPI`. We would then compare the results of the fixed effects model and the random effects model to determine which model is more appropriate for our data. We would also use the **Hausman test** to determine which model is more appropriate for our data. We would then use the model that is more appropriate for our data to analyze the effect of the U.S. economy's performance on the economic growth of other countries while accounting for the factors such as `trade`, `CPI`, `region`, and `income group`.
